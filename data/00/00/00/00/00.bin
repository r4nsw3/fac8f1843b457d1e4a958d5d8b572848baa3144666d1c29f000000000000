  |   Children of Morta sets its story in a distant land but copes with     |
  |   themes closer to our daily lives that one would expect. It is a       |
  |   story of simple emotions we all know so well and value more than      |
  |   sometimes we dare to admit: love and hope, longing and uncertainty,   |
  |   ultimately loss and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the      |
  |   ones we care the most for.                                            |

  |   Embark on the adventure of an extraordinary family of heroes. With    |
  |   the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the           |
  |   Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil. But...      |
  |   it's not a story about saving the universe. It's a story about a      |
  |   valiant family standing together while the world around them is       |
  |   being devoured by darkness.                                           |
